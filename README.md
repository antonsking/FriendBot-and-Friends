### Requirements to begin

You must create a file named  " creds.txt " using your favorite text editor, that looks like this:
```
username
password
account1
account2
...
```

with your username and password filled in, as well as as many other Instagram accounts that are 
similar to yours to train the program to find users interested in your style of content.

if you are a car account named car.pics and your username is 12345, your file would look like this:
```
car.pics
12345
cool.car.photos
supercars.world
crazy.cars.videos
```
take this file, and drag it into the bin folder

Run FriendBot.command, LikeBot.command, or UnfollowBot.command, and profit
